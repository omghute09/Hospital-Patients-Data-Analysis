# Hospital-Patients-Data-Analysis
This dashboard gives a quick overview of hospital patient data. It shows how many patients were treated, how much their treatments cost, and how they responded to care. You can also see differences between male and female patients, how many were readmitted, and which procedures and conditions cost the most.
